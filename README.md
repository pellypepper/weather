Features
Weather Search: Search for weather information by location.
Animated Background: A wave animation that creates a dynamic, calming background.
Letter-by-Letter Title Animation: The app title is displayed one letter at a time, looping continuously.
Navigation Bar: Provides navigation options within the app.
Reusable Components: Modular components for the background, search bar, result display, and more.

Project Structure
App.js: The main application component. Manages data fetching, title animation, and layout.
Background.js: Contains the animated SVG wave background that spans the full page.
SearchBar.js: A search bar component where users can enter a location to fetch weather data.
ResultBar.js: Displays the weather data returned by the API, such as temperature and conditions.
NavBar.js: Contains navigation links and options for the app.
Main Components & Logic
Animated Background (Background.js):

An SVG wave animation is used as a background for the app, creating a dynamic visual effect.
Letter-by-Letter Title Animation (App.js):

Displays the word prop letter by letter using a timed loop controlled by setTimeout.
Resets the display once the full word is shown, repeating the effect.
Weather Data Fetching (verifyURL in App.js):

Uses the Weather utility to fetch data based on user input and updates the app's state to display results in ResultBar.
Weather Icons:

Weather icons (e.g., cloudy.png) are stored in the assets folder and used dynamically based on fetched weather conditions.
How to Use
Search for Weather:

Enter a location in the search bar and press enter to retrieve the weather data for that location.
View Results:

The weather information, including temperature and conditions, will be displayed in the ResultBar component.
Observe Animations:

The app's title animates letter by letter in a loop, and the background provides a continuous wave animation.
